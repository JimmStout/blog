Steve Jobs, the MPEG LA and HTML5's \<video\>.
==============================================

On March 7, Google
[announced](http://blog.webmproject.org/2013/03/vp8-and-mpeg-la.html
"on the webM project blog") they reached an Agreement with
[MPEG-LA](https://pinboard.in/u:hugoroy/t:MPEG-LA/ "articles about
MPEG-LA in my pinboard") around patents that “may” cover the [open
video codec VP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8 "Wikipedia
article on VP8").  

Thanks to this agreement, the most serious concerns that people
had about using VP8 and webM for their videos on the web are gone.
(Well, almost, because Nokia(/Microsoft) [claims to have patents
infringed by VP8 still](https://lwn.net/Articles/545562/ "LWN's
excellent article on the patents war around VP8")).  

Monty from [Xiph.Org](http://www.xiph.org "the Xiph.Org
Foundation"), developer of free software and open video codecs
like [Theora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora "Wikipedia
article on Theora") is [very
happy](http://xiphmont.livejournal.com/59893.html) about this
announcement. Indeed, it shows that MPEG-LA has lost. They did not
have anything serious to bring VP8 down. 

But what should remain from this? I think there are some lessons
to learn here for Free Software. Sure, MPEG-LA has lost. But who
won? Not us, and surely not the Web. 

The whole saga starts from the HTML5 group. Bear in mind that this
effort started outside of the W3C, comprising mainly of
browser-vendors including Apple and Microsoft. I don't have enough
knowledge of the inside politics of this group. But what remains
out of it is that one of the most discussed features of HTML5, the
\<video\> element, is a failure. 

Why's that a failure? Because today, it seems that most of the
time HTML5 videos are encoded solely using the
[restricted-by-patents](http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Pages/Agreement.aspx
"MPEG-LA's patent licensing agreement excludes Free Software")
[AVC/H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/AVC "Wikipedia
article on H.264/AVC") format. That means that publication on the
Web is now restricted by rules determined by a cartel of patent
holders (The MPEG-LA has been under investigation by the US
Department of Justice for anti-trust concerns [since
2011](http://gigaom.com/2011/03/04/doj-investigates-mpeg-la%E2%80%99s-webm-patent-pool/).)

This is certainly not how the web was envisioned. The web was
envisioned with freedom at its core. Just like Tim Berners-Lee
didn't have to ask anybody's permission to [make the Web work 22
years ago](http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2010/12/the-web-is-20/ "The
Web turned 20 in 2010")[¹](#fn-cern-pd), nobody should have to ask
anyone's permission to publish something on the web. 

Now the second attack against HTML5 \<video\> [has
come](http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2012/02/%E2%80%9Cunethical%E2%80%9D-html5-content-restriction-proposal-aka-drm/
"An unethical proposal"). We saw it coming, about a year ago. But
nothing was done. It is only now that I see a reaction (BTW if you
haven't done yet, please sign now to stop Digital Restrictions
Management (DRM) on the Web:
[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5](defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5)).

Make no mistake. These are concordant, and very important changes.
They will deeply change the Web if they succeed. Microsoft, Apple,
Netflix and others want to control who can publish videos (though
patents) and who can watch videos (through DRM). 

The first part (patents) seem lost. We have to fight for the
second part.

But here I want to focus a little bit on how they achieved to
control videos through patents. We never know, this might be
repeated in the future. We should know better how to react to
these things.

These are some of the steps:

1. Make a technical proposal to the HTML5 group.

    Oppose inclusion in the standard of Free Software and claim
    the reason is concerns around patents.

    In case opposition come from Free Software folks, claim there
    is no problem because your proposal can be [included in
    hardware](http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2012/02/%E2%80%9Cunethical%E2%80%9D-html5-content-restriction-proposal-aka-drm)


4. Spread FUD everywhere that Free Software implementations and
technological alternatives are violating patents. 

    (Of course, hope that nobody sees how hypocrite you are,
    because the patent risks come from your own patents and from
    organisations like MPEG-LA of which you are a part of)

3. Make vague threats of lawsuits. Show your muscles.

    (I now regret having participated in this by publishing Steve
    Jobs' answer to my [open
    letter](http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2010/04/open-letter-to-steve-jobs/
    "An open letter to Steve Jobs - and a reply"). I should have
    handled this more carefully and contact other organsations
    like Xiph.Org… This could have been a nice action from FSFE.)

4. Buy yourself time, [continue spreading
FUD](http://www.osnews.com/story/23058/Theora_More_of_a_Patent_Threat_than_H264_Wait_What_)

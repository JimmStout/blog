<h1 id="steve-jobs-the-mpeg-la-and-html5s-video.">Steve Jobs, the MPEG LA and HTML5's &lt;video&gt;.</h1>
<p>On March 7, Google <a href="http://blog.webmproject.org/2013/03/vp8-and-mpeg-la.html" title="on the webM project blog">announced</a> they reached an Agreement with <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:hugoroy/t:MPEG-LA/" title="articles about MPEG-LA in my pinboard">MPEG-LA</a> around patents that “may” cover the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8" title="Wikipedia article on VP8">open video codec VP8</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this agreement, the most serious concerns that people had about using VP8 and webM for their videos on the web are gone. (Well, almost, because Nokia(/Microsoft) <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/545562/" title="LWN&#39;s excellent article on the patents war around VP8">claims to have patents infringed by VP8 still</a>).</p>
<p>Monty from <a href="http://www.xiph.org" title="the Xiph.Org Foundation">Xiph.Org</a>, developer of free software and open video codecs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora" title="Wikipedia article on Theora">Theora</a> is <a href="http://xiphmont.livejournal.com/59893.html">very happy</a> about this announcement. Indeed, it shows that MPEG-LA has lost. They did not have anything serious to bring VP8 down.</p>
<p>But what should remain from this? I think there are some lessons to learn here for Free Software. Sure, MPEG-LA has lost. But who won? Not us, and surely not the Web.</p>
<p>The whole saga starts from the HTML5 group. Bear in mind that this effort started outside of the W3C, comprising mainly of browser-vendors including Apple and Microsoft. I don't have enough knowledge of the inside politics of this group. But what remains out of it is that one of the most discussed features of HTML5, the &lt;video&gt; element, is a failure.</p>
<p>Why's that a failure? Because today, it seems that most of the time HTML5 videos are encoded solely using the <a href="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Pages/Agreement.aspx" title="MPEG-LA&#39;s patent licensing agreement excludes Free Software">restricted-by-patents</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/AVC" title="Wikipedia article on H.264/AVC">AVC/H.264</a> format. That means that publication on the Web is now restricted by rules determined by a cartel of patent holders (The MPEG-LA has been under investigation by the US Department of Justice for anti-trust concerns <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/03/04/doj-investigates-mpeg-la%E2%80%99s-webm-patent-pool/">since 2011</a>.) This is certainly not how the web was envisioned. The web was envisioned with freedom at its core. Just like Tim Berners-Lee didn't have to ask anybody's permission to <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2010/12/the-web-is-20/" title="The Web turned 20 in 2010">make the Web work 22 years ago</a><a href="#fn-cern-pd">¹</a>, nobody should have to ask anyone's permission to publish something on the web.</p>
